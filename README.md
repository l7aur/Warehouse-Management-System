## Conclusions

This assignment proved to be a bit challenging for me because I have never worked before with threads before. The main issue I had was to keep track of the independently running threads especially because I had to adapt the classical way to debug (in console) I am used to so that I could handle and understand the parallel evolution of the program. Another challenge was to break down the application itself into independent modules that can perform more general tasks or are (more or less) open to extension while keeping it simple and easy to understand. I got more familiar to layouts, panels, how they interact and how a more complex window can be designed. I have used group buttons for the first time and tried frame by frame generation. I practiced the decomposition of classes into subclasses and aimed the design short and effective methods that are more suitable to the Java style.

The final application is not the best it can be for sure. I consider its main defects to be the graphical user interface implementation (the code is a bit chaotic). However, the GUI looks decent, is practical and does its job. The backend structure could be optimized as well.

Other further developments:
- Improved class design for the GUI.
- Improved and simplified inter-class connections.
- Improved, simplified, and more specialized intra-class connections.
- New possible strategies for implementation.
- Cleaner, more explicit code style.
